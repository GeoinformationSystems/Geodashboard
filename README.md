_Software is still under development._

This geodashboard prototype combines the components (1) Provenance, (2) Spatial Data Quality and (3) General Metadata. This tool supports data users and data producers to evaluate spatial datasets by combining provenance information with quality information and general metadata in one interface.

## Structure

The Geodashboard Prototype is based on Javascript,  HTML and CSS.
